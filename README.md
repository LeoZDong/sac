# Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) Implementation with TF Agent.

This is an implementation of SAC using TF agent. The code is primarily borrowed from this example: https://github.com/tensorflow/agents/blob/master/tf_agents/agents/sac/examples/v2/train_eval.py. This repo splits the single file into classes and modules. Serves as reference for optimized workflow of RL models in general.
